## Sistragatiwe

Sistragatiwe is a simple multiplatform strategy game.

## Compile

These instructions have been tested on Linux only, because
I'm developing the game on that platform. They should work for
other platforms, too.

Make sure you installed `scons`, enter the directory of the game
and run:

    scons

This should compile the source code. To run the game enter:

    ./sistragatiwe
